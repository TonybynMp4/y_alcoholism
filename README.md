# y_alcoholism
A resource that allows you to fall into alcoholism.
(it adds the effects of alcohol that's it)

## Installation
- qbx_smallresources
  - client/consumables.lua & server/consumables.lua remove the loop / callback related to alcohol
  - config/shared.lua remove (or move them to this script, the config is compatible) the alcohol items

- Download -> put in resources/[whatever-you-want] -> ensure y_alcoholism -> Enjoy! (kinda weird to say that)

## Features
 - Ability to get drunk
   - Different effects with levels of severity
   - Ability to go in ethyl coma
   - Ability to develop resistance to alcohol
   - Your dunk-ness is saved so you can't avoid it by disconnecting!
